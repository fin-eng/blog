                  <div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_overview">Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On 2nd of October 2019, the ECB first published €STR, an overnight
interest rate which effectively replaces EONIA within the EU benchmark
reform framework. For the transition period, until 3rd January 2022, EONIA is still published
as a 8.5 basis points spread above €STR. The
<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/initiatives/interest_rate_benchmarks/WG_euro_risk-free_rates/html/index.en.html">ECB
working group on euro risk-free rates</a> made the recommendation to
switch interest paid on collateral from EONIA to €STR. While different
approaches for the transition were considered, the preferred one was a
so called "big bang" introduction: moving completely away from EONIA to
€STR flat while compensating for PnL implications due to the 8.5 basis
points spread between the two reference rates. Central counterparties
(CCPs)
followed the recommendation and will move to €STR discounting
on or around 22nd of June 2020. On that date, CCPs will conduct a one
off compensation mechanism to neutralize the PnL effects on members
portfolios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For swaption holders the above approach can be rather problematic, as
many swaptions reference to cleared underlyings (either a physically
cleared swap or a collateralized cash price type of settlement).
With that link to a cleared swap, the valuation of a swaption depends
on the CCPs methodology of discounting and is therefore affected by the
"big bang". Now the problem is that the compensation mechanism of the
CCP is not "eligible" for all those swaptions that
haven&#8217;t expired before the "big bang" date, as they aren&#8217;t in the
trade population of the CCP. Compensation can
therefore only be addressed in the bilateral relationship between the
trading partners. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.isda.org">ISDA</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the biggest and most important
institution providing legal frameworks for derivative contracts&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;has
no provisions for a discount rate switch in its master agreements.
With that missing piece in the documentation, the legal enforceability
of a compensation payment is potentially weak. At the moment there
seems to be no clear consensus within the industry, whether there
should be a compensation for the value effects on swaptions or not.
Without that, we are probably on course for huge value transfers on
"big bang" day (below we will see that the market is actually "betting" on that
outcome).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we dive into all the details of the subject, I want to invite you
to get in contact to share your views, as the topic is still very
"fluid" and interesting to discuss.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_can_we_derive_from_the_market_that_no_compensation_is_probably_the_most_likely_scenario">How can we derive from the market that "no compensation" is probably the most likely scenario?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are quotes in the broker market that give us a hint on how the
market is pricing that scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code><em>1y30y A+500 receiver over 1y30y A+500 payer, CCP LCH, with 100% 1y fwd
30y LCH swap A+500 (all same strike)  60/250</em></code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above case somebody is willing to buy / sell an 5% in the money
receiver swaption, while selling / buying a 5% out of the money payer
swaption. The buyer is willing to pay 60c and the seller quotes 250c.
To offset the delta from the construct, a cleared swap with the same
strike is traded (further note that the two swaptions also have
offsetting vega risk). With zero market risk, this instrument should
trade at a zero premium. But if you now take into consideration that
the cleared swap will be part of the upcoming compensation process,
because it is cleared now, and the swaptions will potentially not, because they
expire after the "big bang", a positive premium could be warranted. Let
us now analyse how likely a "no compensation" is:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The structure has a discount delta of 25.5c. Multiplied by 8.5 we get
217. Those 217c would approximately be the fair mid in case no
compensation is for sure. If we take the mid from the above quote
(155c), we arrive at <code>71% probability of a "no compensation" scenario.</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another possible source of footprints towards "no compensation" can be
<a href="https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/post/cash_physical_intro/">cash IRR vs. CCP settled swaptions</a>.
The reason is that cash IRR swaptions have a payoff function that is
only linked to the observed swap rate at expiry. This swap rate is
almost not affected from the switch by €STR. If you now sell a cash
IRR swaption straddle and buy a CCP straddle against it, you will (almost for
sure) end up with an in the money swap on the CCP leg profiting from
the switch to €STR.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the data for some hints if the above has occurred
(physical over cash premiums):</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/ESTR/phy_cash.png" alt="Physical over cash premiums">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. 10y30y physical over cash premiums</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see a steep increase in November 2019 which fits our guess of
richening physical / cash CCP vs. cash IRR straddles. But we should
take this outcome with a pinch of salt as cash IRR straddles are in
essence complex CMS products. Also this market is quite illiquid and
one-sided. But still, it is another hint at a market pricing in the
direction of a "no
compensation" scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In summary there is clear evidence that the market is pricing in a
high probability for making the transfer to €STR without compensating
the discounting difference.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_discount_rate_do_we_actually_trade_when_we_execute_a_swaption">What discount rate do we actually trade when we execute a swaption?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Short answer: it depends. Lets focus first on the dealer market were
most of the risk transfer is taking place and from which prices to the
buy-side are typically derived. Preferred dealer hedge instrument are swaption
straddles. If you have traded a 10y10y
swaption straddle at the end of 2018, you would probably have executed
it as cash settled instrument based on the CCP methodology and you
would have reasonably assumed it is discounted with EONIA till the
very end (or at least something that mimics the EONIA discounting
value). With the announcement of the "big bang" that has changed, and
given you expect no compensation, all straddles that expire post "big
bang" are de facto €STR discounted (more precisely the window until expiry
will most likely still be EONIA depending on the cash CSA, but from
then it is €STR).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With everything that hasn&#8217;t a direct CCP link (e. g. swaptions that
settle into a bilateral swap, embedded swaptions like callables, cash
IRR swaptions) the story is different: Although you might change the
cash CSA to €STR in the future, you are completely OK to value those
trades with EONIA because you (or your counterparty) will only accept
the switch if a compensation payment is paid in return.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If swaptions are completely uncollateralized, your discount rate might
involve your own funding spread. As a switch to €STR itself shouldn&#8217;t
change the absolute rate at which an institutions is borrowing, that
discount rate will most likely stay the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_brokers_started_publishing_str_discounted_vols_along_with_eonia_discounted_vols_do_we_need_both_is_there_a_new_basis">Brokers started publishing €STR discounted vols along with EONIA discounted vols: Do we need both? Is there a new basis?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Probably finding yet another basis to trade on is one of the most
innovative sectors of
the financial industry since the financial crisis.
But before we start trading that new basis, let&#8217;s take a
look at the vol surface based on the "old" EONIA annuities:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/ESTR/EONIA_vols.png" alt="EONIA vols">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Annual bp vols calculated under an EONIA annuity</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, what is the difference when we look at the vols based on €STR
annuities? It turns out that those are lower than the ones above. Let&#8217;s see by how
much:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/ESTR/ESTR_EONIA_vol_diff.png" alt="ESTR EONIA vol diff">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. EONIA over €STR vols</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OK we have a difference, but can it really be the case that 10y10y
swaptions have a different volatility depending on the used discount
rate?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the concept of volatility you have in mind, that might
sound counter-intuitive. But let&#8217;s look at Black&#8217;s world and how the
straddle (forward) premium is defined (with t the option expiry, T the
underlying maturity, r the interest rate, and sigma the Black normal vol):</p>
</div>
<div class="stemblock">
<div class="content">
\[Premium_{t} = \sum\limits_{t}^T \frac{1}{(1+r_{t})^t} *
\Bigg [\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} * \sigma * \sqrt{t}\Bigg ]\]
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above is the straddle price in a Black normal world. The left part
is the annuity and in square brackets we can see sigma or the annual
bp vol. From the formula it becomes clear that we can only hit the
same price (and there is only one price for each straddle) under a
different annuity when we simultaneously change the sigma.
Now it should become clear that there are not two vols that can
co-exist in parallel in our framework. It&#8217;s rather that you have
to make up your mind which is the appropriate annuity (the market says
€STR!), back out the associated vol, and throw away the other vol
because ultimately there is only one vol to every straddle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nonetheless, it can be useful to think in terms of two vols when you
look at certain pricings:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say you are pricing a callable and your system still is on an EONIA
curve framework. Your machine should hit the straddle price as your
reference for pricing pretty well (a good thing!). But now comes the
problematic part: because of the EONIA annuity it backs out a too high
vol, which it uses in the subsequent callable pricing. Here the
concept of a second vol comes in quite handy because the difference
is a good proxy for the error you are making in the pricing. Say the
vol is half a bp lower and you have 100k vega on your callable: that
means you are marking the callable 50k too high (because of not being
exactly at the money, the effect is a bit overstated)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_which_prices_do_we_hit_with_our_old_eonia_based_valuation_framework">Which prices do we hit with our old EONIA based valuation framework?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a first glance and from the above it might be tempting to say: OK,
I got the wrong framework for €STR swaptions, so I won&#8217;t hit the
prices in that area. But clearly, on a second thought, we plug in the
wrong inputs (EONIA vols + EONIA annuity) and therefore come up with
the right answer: We hit the premiums traded on swaptions in the
dealer market. So unfortunately it is (mainly) the swaptions with "real" EONIA
underlying that we price inaccurately, as you can see below:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist checklist">
<div class="title">Which prices do we hit?</div>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>
<p>&#10003; ATM Straddles (CCP cash / physically cleared)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#10003; OTM Payers / Receivers (CCP cash / physically cleared)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#10063; ITM Payers / Receivers (CCP cash / physically cleared)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#10003; Cash IRR Swaptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#10063; Callables / embedded Options in structured swaps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#10063; Physically non-cleared Swaptions</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_wrong_is_an_eonia_based_valuation_framework_on_a_portfolio_level">How wrong is an EONIA based valuation framework on a portfolio level?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, finding the exact answer would involve updating the valuation
machinery to a proper €STR framework. But at least for a proxy estimate there
is no need to do the heavy lifting right away. Unfortunately, we still have
to make an assumption, but at least it is a valid one for many
portfolios: as a total, the vega from all swaption products, is
relatively flat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that scenario you can just filter your portfolio on all swaptions
with link to a cleared underlying and extract the discount delta from
all those trades. Multiplying that number by 8.5 basis points should
yield a pretty good PnL estimate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just to highlight why a flat position is needed to make that proxy
accurate: Say you only have ATM and OTM CCP linked swaptions. Here you
are already correct in your valuation and our proxy estimate would
only give a zero adjustment if long and short positions cancel out
properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now say your total portfolio is flat, but it is not flat
with regards to positions in underlyings linked to vs. not linked to a
CCP. Here you might correct the value of a ATM straddle you hit, but
essentially it the bilateral trade mimicking the vega on the straddle,
that you got wrong. So here the proxy is quite good in working out the
correct PnL effect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_would_a_proper_str_based_valuation_framework_look_like">How would a proper €STR based valuation framework look like?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now we really want to set everything up in a way that our valuation
mechanisms are completely consistent in the new €STR world. As
everybody should be familiar with multi-curve frameworks, €STR is
only just one more curve added to the already existent curves. But
nevertheless, including swaptions imply the need for some further thoughts
on how the whole machinery should be set up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first important point was already mentioned above: As soon as you
start calculating with €STR annuities you will also need&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if not
implying from premiums&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;€STR based volatilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second major distinction is hybrid discount curves: Here the
rationale is that you might switch from a bilateral underlying to an
underlying with CCP link. As those distinct periods may be accompanied with
different discounting regimes, there is the need to "split" the
discounting into two separate periods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

previously highlighted points:</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_the_outlook_on_swaptions_with_time_running_out_towards_big_bang_day">What is the outlook on swaptions with time running out towards "big bang" day?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above we touched on many aspects related to swaptions approaching "big
bang" day. Now we want to come back to the central piece
of the matter: which is compensation for the discount effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be argued that such a switch shouldn&#8217;t create
winners and losers in market. If we look at the intentional dimension,
it probably wasn&#8217;t the case that market participants had a value
transfer due to discounting in mind when they transacted swaptions in
the past. As the
instrument was presumably designed for purely reflecting value with regards to
an intrinsic and a time value, there could be a will within the industry to
preserve that sole function&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not at least to show that it can be a reliable
hedge instrument in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So there might be a will to find consensus around the
intentional dimension. If that can be achieved in the still going on
initiatives, some <code>agreement / protocol / best practise</code> paving the way
towards compensation might be coming out. But still, even if such an
outcome can be found, it has to be respected by the whole industry to
be effective, as it will probably lack true enforceability.</p>
