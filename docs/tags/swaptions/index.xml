      <description>Overview In 2020 we had some unprecedented movements in global markets coming from the Covid-19 pandemic. Initially the hit to asset prices was tremendous and volatility got to highs not seen for a long time. For a moment, the paradigm of putting on a carry trades in all asset classes, seemed completely vanished. But this short glimpse at how market forces could reach new equilibrium price levels, was just not bearable for institutions in developed capital markets.</description>

      <title>Switching to €STR: &#34;Big Bang&#34; troubles for Swaptions</title>

      <description>Overview On 2nd of October 2019, the ECB first published €STR, an overnight interest rate which effectively replaces EONIA within the EU benchmark reform framework. For the transition period, until 3rd January 2022, EONIA is still published as a 8.5 basis points spread above €STR. The ECB working group on euro risk-free rates made the recommendation to switch interest paid on collateral from EONIA to €STR. While different approaches for the transition were considered, the preferred one was a so called &amp;#34;big bang&amp;#34; introduction: moving completely away from EONIA to €STR flat while compensating for PnL implications due to the 8.</description>

      <title>Collateralized Cash Price --- An introduction to the new settlement standard in Swaptions</title>

      <description>Overview For years the Euro Swaption Market was split into two major types of settlement methods: one being Physical and the other one being a cash settlement based on an Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The latter was causing that many serious valuation problems recently that a new market standard will be established, effective from 26th November 2018 onwards, where the IRR will be &amp;#34;swapped&amp;#34; for a discount rate associated with collateralized swap contracts: a Collateralized Cash Price (CCP).</description>

      <title>Collateralized Cash Price --- A consistent pricing framework (part I)</title>

      <description>Overview With the change in the market standard cash settlement convention from an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) approach to Cash Collateralized Price (CCP), effective in September or October 2018, remains a bit of a challenge to put legacy trades, forthcoming new-style transactions, and physically settled contracts into a consisting pricing framework.
 In this small series we will present a Python implementation in which all mentioned trades are valued in an arbitrage free fashion.</description>

      <description>Overview In the previous article, we gathered all the data needed. We will now utilize that information to calibrate our model. As it takes some functions and dependencies, our approach will be to put all the calibration code into three classes. In that regard we will have an &amp;#34;ImpliedVol&amp;#34; class, which does the vol implication from premiums. Also we have a superclass &amp;#34;CashPhyATM&amp;#34;, doing the basic calibration for ATM data. There is a subclass to &amp;#34;CashPhyATM&amp;#34;, called &amp;#34;CashPhyOTM&amp;#34;, calculating all the OTM values.</description>

      <description>Overview In the previous article we calibrated cash IRR payer, cash IRR receiver and physical vols in the physical measure. These sets of vols allowed us to value all settlement types in an arbitrage-free fashion. Nevertheless, what we were still lacking, was a complete vol cube for every single settlement type. As it is well known that &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; interpolation techniques fail with respect that they are not proven to be free of arbitrage, we select the SABR model as a popular choice for completing the vol cube.</description>
