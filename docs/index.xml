      <description>My name is Oliver Kahl. Let me have an educated guess, that you are as enthusiastic and interested in finance and markets as the many people in the industry I&amp;#8217;m daily talking to: be it in person, phone, chat, blog or whatever means of communication. Given that you are also thrilled and excited what rapid change finance has and will experience in the light of brilliant technologies at our fingertips&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;probably we have a perfect match.</description>

      <description>Overview Futures are an excellent way of gaining access and exposure to various asset classes. The contracts are often much more liquid than their underlyings, long- and short positions can be entered equally easy, and there is no cash changing hands involved by entering a position (we only refer here to the investment needed for being long in the cash market; of course there is margining with Futures, which also implies needs for liquidity).</description>
