      <description>My name is Oliver Kahl. Let me have an educated guess, that you are as enthusiastic and interested in finance and markets as the many people in the industry I&amp;#8217;m daily talking to: be it in person, phone, chat, blog or whatever means of communication. Given that you are also thrilled and excited what rapid change finance has and will experience in the light of brilliant technologies at our fingertips&amp;#8201;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8201;probably we have a perfect match.</description>

      <title>Collateralized Cash Price --- An introduction to the new settlement standard in Swaptions</title>

      <description>Overview For years the Euro Swaption Market was split into two major types of settlement methods: one being Physical and the other one being a cash settlement based on an Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The latter was causing that many serious valuation problems recently that a new market standard will be established effective from 1st of July 2018 onwards, where the IRR will be &#34;swapped&#34; for a discount rate associated with collateralized swap contracts: a Collateralized Cash Price (CCP).</description>

      <title>Collateralized Cash Price --- Building a consistent pricing framework part I</title>

      <description>With the change in the market standard cash settlement convention from an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) approach to Cash Collateralized Price (CCP), effective on 1st July 2018, it remains a bit of a challenge to put legacy trades, forthcoming new-style transactions, and physically settled contracts into a consisting pricing framework.
 In this small series we will present a Python implementation in which all mentioned trades are valued in an arbitrage free fashion.</description>

      <title>Continuous Futures: Construction Methods</title>
      <link>https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/post/continuous_futures_part1/</link>

      <description>Overview Futures are an excellent way of gaining access and exposure to various asset classes. The contracts are often much more liquid than their underlyings, long- and short positions can be entered equally easy, and there is no cash changing hands involved by entering a position (we only refer here to the investment needed for being long in the cash market; of course there is margining with Futures, which also implies needs for liquidity).</description>

      <title>Continuous Futures: Visualization &amp; Signal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://fin-eng.github.io/blog/continuous_futures_part2/</link>

      <description>Overview In the first article of this mini series we talked about building Continuous Futures which satisfy our requirements for deriving consistent PnL figures for our position keeping, as well as generating trading signals not effected by roll gaps between contracts. A solution of simply splicing contracts after each other clearly didn&amp;#8217;t qualify, and we came up with the Panama Method being the closest to an ideal time-series for our data set of German Government Bonds (Schatz, Bobl, Bund).</description>
