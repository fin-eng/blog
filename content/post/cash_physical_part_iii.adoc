=== Overview

:source-language: python
:imagesdir: /Users/Olli/Blog_Artikel/

In the previous article we calibrated cash IRR payer, cash IRR
receiver and physical vols in the physical measure. These sets of vols
allowed us to value all settlement types in an arbitrage-free fashion.
Nevertheless, what we were still lacking, was a complete vol cube for
every single settlement type. As it is well known that "regular"
interpolation techniques fail with respect that they are not proven to
be free of arbitrage, we select the SABR model as a popular choice for
completing the vol cube.

As it is not our main focus here to implement the most
"sophisticated" version of SABR, but rather an example what is the
next logical step after calibrating vols from observed market
premiums, we stick to the basic version of SABR: Hagan et al.
"Managing Smile Risk". The only amendment we make here is, that
we explicitly allow for negative rates by utilizing a "shifted"
version of the original model.

=== Approaching calibration

As pointed out above, we have flagged vols with three category types:
"cash receiver", "cash payer" and "physical". These categories go into
calibration separately. On each category we apply a sorting algorithm
which is based on the "group-by" operation in Pandas. The logic of the
grouping is simply that we look how many quotes we have over the full
range of strikes. We start with those groups having covered all
strikes with quotes and work our way though to those groups having
fewer and fewer strikes. Each calibration starts with it's neighbours
parameter outcome (the first calibration has a naive initial guess).
As there are a lot of expiry/ tail combinations where only ATM quotes
are available, we use interpolation of the calibrated SABR
parameters. For this we utilize Scipy "Griddata". 

One more comment beforehand: As there is a bit of redundancy with
regards to the SABR parameters, we fix beta at 0.5 (a
choice often seen in SABR implementations).

To get well prepared for calibration we enrich our "vols_sabr_in"
DataFrame with the parameter columns. Furthermore, we build
calibration groups according to the number of available quotes over
the range of strikes. See below:

=== SABR parameter calibration

As outlined above we now give our "groups" into calibration. The
calibration itself will be done by the SABR class. We drip feed it group
by group and later interpolate parameters where only ATM quotes are
available. The algorithm is outlined below:

            calib_results = np.append(calib_results, temp_par.T, axis = 0)
vols_sabr_in.iloc[:,14:] = calib_results

After running through the calibration we now have all the SABR parameters in our "vols_sabr_in" DataFrame.

=== SABR vol calculation

Before calling the "SABR_out" method from our SABR class, we do one final parameter calibration and then feed these parameters into "SABR_out" as outlined below:

[source, python]
----
vols_sabr_out = pd.DataFrame(columns = strikes, index = vols_sabr_in.index)
calib_results = np.empty((0,4))
for line in vols_sabr_in.itertuples():
    sabr_par = SABR(line[1], line[2], line.Index[1] / 12,
                    strikes, np.array(line[3:14]),line[16],
        np.array([vols_sabr_in['alpha'][line.Index], vols_sabr_in['rho'][line.Index],
                  vols_sabr_in['nu'][line.Index]]))
    calib_results = np.vstack((calib_results, [sabr_par.alpha, 0.5,
                                               sabr_par.rho, sabr_par.nu]))
    vols_sabr_out.loc[line.Index] = sabr_par.SABR_out()
vols_sabr_in.iloc[:,14:] = calib_results
----

=== Inspection of the calibration results

As a first step, it makes sense to pick those expiry/ tail
combinations where we have a full range of market quotes. In the
following we choose four expiry/ tail combinations -- in the hope to
capture the majority of the vol structure -- for our three vol types.
We inspect the fit visually by Matplotlib charts:

[#img-SABR_phy]
.Fit SABR vs market for physical (cash CCP) settlement.
image::/phy_sabr_smile.png[SABR phy smile, 800, 600, align = "left"]

[#img-SABR_cash_rec]
.Fit SABR vs market for cash IRR receiver.
image::/cash_rec_sabr_smile.png[SABR cash rec smile, 800, 600, align = "left"]

[#img-SABR_cash_pay]
.Fit SABR vs market for cash IRR payer.
image::/cash_pay_sabr_smile.png[SABR cash pay smile, 800, 600, align = "left"]

It can been seen that expiry/ tail combinations which lie in the mid
of the vol structure calibrate best. Longer and shorter combinations
don't fit equally well and also calibration on the wings of the
distribution exhibit some problems. Those problems are well known with
SABR and there are extensions to the original model that promise
better fits.

As a last piece, we present a 30y30y smile comparioson between cash IRR receiver, cash IRR payer and physical (CCP) vols similar to the one we already showed in the previous article because here cash/ physical basis should be the most pronounced.

[#img-SABR_30y_30y_smile]
.SABR 30y30y smile for all settlement types.
image::/30y30y_swaption_smile.png[SABR 30y30y smile, 800, 600, align = "left"]

Here as well we see some problems of SABR on the right wing, where
payers first seem to undershoot and then overshoot a bit, but
hopefully you can get the picture: A combination of shifted log-vol
implication, explicit cash-physical model calibration and a SABR model
is able to yield a pricing maschinery that is able to supply a
complete vol cubes for all settlement types. Therefore, an
implementation similar to the one presented here in this series should
put you in a position to consistently price all standard vanilla
options.
