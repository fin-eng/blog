=== Overview

In the previous article, we gathered all the data needed. We will now
utilize that information to calibrate our model. As it takes some
functions and dependencies, our approach will be to put all the
calibration code into three classes. In that regard we will have an
"ImpliedVol" class, which does the vol implication from premiums. Also
we have a superclass "CashPhyATM", doing the basic calibration for ATM
data. There is a subclass to "CashPhyATM", called "CashPhyOTM",
calculating all the OTM values. The rest of our work will be done in a
Jupyter Notebook. For our modelling we use Pietersz and Sengers
"Cash-settled swaptions: A new pricing model".

=== Vol Implication

The first step will be the implying of a shifted-log-normal volatility
for all the premiums we collected this far. For this we will use the
paper from Jaeckel (see references below). As a reminder our input
DataFrame, "cash_prem", looks like this:

[#img-master_df]
.Cash premiums going into vol implication.
image::/master_df.png[Master DataFrame, 750, 500]

In principal we now iterate over our "cash_prem" DataFrame, to
transform all the premiums into vols and print it back to a new,
"vols", DataFrame. The following piece will do this:

With that being done, we have a full ATM vol surface for ATM physical,
ATM IRR receiver, and ATM IRR payer swaptions (all at the physical
forward). Note that we have also calibrated vols for OTM strikes in
IRR swaptions, but due to the lack of more information those surfaces
are far from being "complete". At this stage we also have no
information on physical smile data. But let's inspect something, which
is already complete, namely the ATM physical swaption surface:

[#img-ATM_phy_vol]
.ATM physical swaption surface.
image::/ATM_physical_swaption_surface.png[ATM physical swaption surface, width = "100%", height= "100%", align = "left"]

=== Align cash IRR and physical (cash CCP) vols

==== Description of the approach

Thus far we did nothing more than a regular (shifted) Black log-normal
vol implication. The "CashPhyATM" superclass and it's "CashPhyOTM"
subclass will now be our working horse to get all swaptions, namely
cash IRR and physical (and CCP as being equivalent), aligned in an
arbitrage free fashion.

But let's have a look at the basic idea of Pietersz and Sengers for
modeling the above. They start with two processes, which financially
turn out to be the sum of discount factors (present value of a basis
point (PVBP)) and the EURIBOR forwards (y) for all the considered
periods. On top of that, they consider another process, y*, such that
the PVBP process is a constant scalar times the cash-annuity of y*. As
outlined by Pietersz and Sengers, we start the PVBP process with it's
value as of today and model it with shifted log-normal dynamics. In
the following we refer to y and y* -- in analogy to Pietersz and
Sengers -- with the terms forecast forward rate and discount forward
rate respectively. The forthcoming modeling will be done with 4
parameters in our shifted log-normal framework: forecast sigma and
forecast shift for y and discount sigma and discount shift for y*.

From that framework a new put-call-parity relation for for IRR
swaptions at the convexity adjusted forward/ PVBP (Fwd*/ PVBP*) can be
obtained. We use that relation to arrive at prices for the various
swaptions not observed in the market. Eventually, we get vols for IRR
payer/ receiver and physical, which can then be further processed by a
SABR model (next article) to complete the vol cube.

Let's sum up what we already have before calibration:

* ATM physical-settled vols
* ATM IRR settled vols
* OTM IRR settled vols

And this is what we will compute in the following:

* Discount/ cash-settled forwards (where put-call-parity holds for IRR
  settlement)
* Discount/ cash-settled displacement
* Discount/ cash-settled ATM vol (at the discount/ cash-settled
  forward)
* Discount/ cash-settled PVBP
* OTM physical-settled vols
* ITM physical-settled vols
* ITM IRR settled vols

The "vols" DataFrame representation of the above now looks like this:

[#img-cash_phy_input]
.Cash/ physical ATM calibration input.
image::/cash_phy_cal_input.PNG[Cash Phy ATM, hight = "100%", width = "100%"]

==== ATM calibration

The following shows, how we iterate over the "vols" DataFrame and call
the respective methods from the "CashPhyATM" class, to obtain the
above sketched out measures with regard to the ATM point:

[source, python]
----
for line in vols.itertuples():
    if line[11] == line[12]:
        vols['ATM Cash*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = line[11]
        vols['Shift*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = line[4]
        vols['PVBP*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = line[6]
        vols['Fwd*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = line[2]
        vols['ATM PCC'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = 0
    else:     
        cash_phy_atm_calib = CashPhyATM(line[12], line[11], line.Index[0] / 12, line[4],
                                        line[2], line[8], line[9], int(line.Index[1] / 12))
        vols['ATM Cash*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]\
            = cash_phy_atm_calib.vol_atm_cash
        vols['Shift*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]\
            = cash_phy_atm_calib.cash_settled_displacement
        vols['PVBP*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]\
            = cash_phy_atm_calib.get_convexity_adjusted_pvbp()
        vols['Fwd*'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]\
            = cash_phy_atm_calib.get_convexity_adjusted_forward()
        vols['ATM PCC'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]\
            = cash_phy_atm_calib.get_put_call_combo_value()
----

Now we have added all calibrated ATM parameters to our DataFrame. 

==== OTM calibration

In the next step, we move away from the ATM point and calibrate all
our grid points for OTM, where we observe market quotes. By using
put-call-parity we also compute ITM swaptions for these points.
Additionally, we calculate physical smile data, an area where market
prices are not observable. Before we start, we reorganise the
target DataFrame a bit, to better serve our needs. We call this
DataFrame "vols_sabr_in" as it is the basis for applying the SABR
model in the next article. Basically we add a type flag to our
MultiIndex, which indicates whetver we have a "cash IRR receiver", a
"cash IRR payer" or a "physical" vol. In it's empty form the DataFrame
now looks like this:

[#img-sabr_cal_input]
.Cash/ physical OTM calibration input (goes into SABR calibration later)
image::/sabr_cal_input.PNG[Cash Phy ATM, height = "100%", width = "100%"]

The following piece of code in combination with the "CashPhyOTM" class
will fill the "vols_sabr_in" DataFrame for us:

[source, python]
----
for line in vols.itertuples():
    for strike_number, strike_offset in enumerate(vols_sabr_in.columns[2:].values):
        if strike_offset < 0:
            if np.isnan(line[14 + strike_number]):
                pass
            else:
                cash_phy_otm_calib = CashPhyOTM(line.Index[0] / 12, line[4], line[2],
                                                line[8], line[9], 
                                                int(line.Index[1] / 12), 'put',
                                                strike_offset / 10000,
                                                line[14 + strike_number],
                                                line[10], line[5], line[13], line[7])
                vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Phy'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]],\
                vol_cash_star = cash_phy_otm_calib.calibrate_cash_model()
                vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Pay'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] =
                cash_phy_otm_calib.get_implied_vol(
                                        'call', line[5], vol_cash_star,
                    vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Phy'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]]
                                                                    )                       
        if strike_offset > 0:
            if np.isnan(line[13 + strike_number]):
                pass
            else:
                cash_phy_otm_calib = CashPhyOTM(line.Index[0] / 12, line[4], line[2],
                                                line[8], line[9], int(line.Index[1] / 12),
                                                'call', strike_offset / 10000,
                                                line[13 + strike_number],
                                                line[10], line[5], line[13], line[7])
                vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Phy'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]],\
                vol_cash_star = cash_phy_otm_calib.calibrate_cash_model()

                    vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Rec'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] =\
                    cash_phy_otm_calib.get_implied_vol(
                                            'put', line[5], vol_cash_star,

                    vols_sabr_in[strike_offset]['Rec'][line.Index[0]][line.Index[1]] = np.nan
                    print(line.Index[0] / 12, int(line.Index[1] / 12),
                          strike_offset, "Receiver value through intrinsic")  
----

Now we have milked our model dry in a sense that we have calibrated as
many vols as we could get from market premiums in combination with
what the model is able to do for us.

=== Visual inspection of the calibrated data

Now we essentially have three types of vols at the physical measure:
cash IRR receiver, cash IRR payer and physical (cash CCP). That is
exactly what we were after. So let's inspect how the different vols
relate to each other:

[#img-10y10y_smile]
.10y10y swaption smile with different settlement types.
image::/10y10y_swaption_smile.png[10y10y swaption smile, 800, 600, align = "left"]

Note that if we would move to the cash IRR measure, we would observe different vols for payer and receiver for physical settlement. Therefore another interesting comparison in that space is, how physical and cash IRR forwards relate to each other. The following is a table of cash IRR forwards over physical forwards in BP:

[#img-cash_over_phy_forwards]
.Convexity adjusted cash IRR Forwards over physical forwards in BP.
image::/cash_over_phy_fwds.PNG[cash over phy forwards, height = "100%", width = "100%"]

We see that the convexity adjustment is most pronounced on the bottom
right of the table (which corresponds well with how zero-wide-collar
prices are distributed).

As we have now completed the calibration for every spot where a market
price has been observed the next logical step would be to complete the
whole vol cube. As "regular" interpolation techniques are known to
fail with respect to arbitrage concerns, a typical choice to arrive at
a robust cube, is the SABR model. This is exactly what will be done in
the next article.
